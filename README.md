# Stock Price Movement Predictor (Learning Project)

This is a personal learning project where I’m building a system to predict whether a stock will go **up** or **down** the next day, using real historical data and machine learning.

I'm not an expert — this project is helping me learn how ML works in practice, especially in finance. The end goal is to turn this into a **multi-model predictor** (XGBoost, LSTM, maybe even Transformers), with a simple UI where the user can choose a stock and a prediction model.
